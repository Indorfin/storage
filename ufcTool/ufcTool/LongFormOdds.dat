The bets picked by my algorithm will be in the comments once I do the math on those. This way, you can verify that the comment remains unedited after the event. If the bets are changed, the comment will be deleted and replaced. The sets of odds in this post are rougher estimates of when you should place a bet, and I can't promise that they'll be as profitable as the bets picked by the algorithm.

How to read the results

Each set of odds represents the **least profitable** odds at which you should bet on them.

Confidence: The sum of everyone's score for how well they know the fight

r/UFCTool Picks: How many members of this subreddit made picks. In my experience, you should only count odds generated from 5 or more picks

Okay Bet: The least cautious set of odds. This will generally result in a bet or two for each event.

Good Bet: A (usually) more cautious set of odds. This will not pick bets nearly as often as Okay Bet, but on average, will be more profitable.

Safe Bet: The most cautious set of odds. This set will not pick a bet very often, but when it does, these are highly likely to be profitable.
